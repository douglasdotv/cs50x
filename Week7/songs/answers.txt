1 - If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Answer:
We could take a look at the average energy, valence, and danceability values and come up with some kind of index for the user.

2 - Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Answer:
Taking a look at the top 100 songs essentially ignores how musical tastes can change over the year and some genres that are not overplayed.
We would need to look at more than just what was played the most. We should consider how tastes change over time and in different situations.
Maybe we could also factor in other stuff like user playlists, skipped songs etc. to generate a more accurate aura.
