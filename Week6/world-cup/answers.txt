Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations, the teams with the lowest ratings never show up on the answer.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I would choose N = 100000. The predictions seem to be good enough with that value, and increasing N to 1000000 costs a lot of time.
