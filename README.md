# CS50

## Overview

This repository contains materials for CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It includes practice problems, labs and problem sets for each week, along with a final project.

## Course Description

CS50 teaches problem-solving both with and without code, emphasizing correctness, design, and style. The course covers computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and more. It starts with C, covering the fundamentals of programming and computer operations, then transitions to Python, and introduces web technologies like SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and related frameworks). The course also delves into lectures about cybersecurity and artificial intelligence and culminates in a final project, where students design and implement a solution to a problem of their choice.

## Academic Honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable". So, please don't submit solutions on this repository as your own work. Instead, use the code as a reference and try to solve the problems yourself. If you are stuck on a specific problem, you can ask for help on the CS50 communities, like the [CS50 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/), [CS50 Discord server](https://discord.gg/cs50) or [CS50 Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/). You can also reach out to me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/305813116669919233), I don't mind helping out.
